# NYC-Seasonal-Patterns (2010-2025)
📊 Project Title

Analyzing Seasonal Electricity Consumption Patterns in NYC Developments (2010–2025)

📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes 15 years of electricity consumption data from the New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) to uncover seasonal trends, borough-level differences, and long-term shifts in energy usage. Visuals were created using Python and Tableau to support pattern recognition and storytelling.

📍 Research Questions
	1.	When does electricity usage peak — summer or winter?
	2.	Do seasonal usage patterns vary across boroughs?
	3.	Has the seasonal pattern shifted over the years (e.g., due to climate, efficiency, or behavioral change)?
 
🗂️ Data Source
	•	NYC Open Data – NYCHA Electricity Consumption

 🔬 Description of the Notebook

In the notebook, data was cleaned, grouped, and visualized to answer the research questions. The process involved:
	•	Data Cleaning:
	•	Removed entries with missing values or irrelevant boroughs (e.g., “FHA”)
	•	Standardized date formats and renamed columns for clarity
	•	Aggregation:
	•	Grouped by Year, Month, and Borough
	•	Computed monthly average consumption (KWH) across time
	•	Visualizations:
	•	Line plots showing seasonal trends for each year
	•	Borough-level comparisons by month
	•	Monthly peak detection using average KWH

 🌟 Key Visual Highlights
	•	Bar Chart (Tableau): Shows which months (July/August) have the highest average usage across years
	•	Line Chart (Tableau): Highlights how boroughs differ in energy use patterns
	•	Python Plots: Show year-by-year seasonal shifts, suggesting potential effects of efficiency or policy changes

Conclusion: 
The analysis confirmed that electricity consumption peaks in summer, especially in July and August. Although the overall seasonal pattern is consistent, boroughs show variations in energy usage.
